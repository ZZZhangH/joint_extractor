to control the avatar in Morse with skeleton tracking package, please run the followings; 

roscore
morse run morse/examples/tutorials/new_human_control.py
roslaunch skeleton_tracking tracking.launch (which plays the .Oni file written in the launch file)

or

roscore
morse run morse/examples/tutorials/new_human_control.py
roslaunch skeleton_tracking trackingRC.launch (which runs on real stream from Asus Xtion)
